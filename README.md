# jQuerySimpleZoom
Super simple zoom!

jQuery Simple Zoom is a barebones zoom library created as a jQuery plugin and is made to be as easy and lightweight as possible

# Useage
The plugin takes 2 arguments:
'in' - The key that will control the inwards zoom
and
'out' - The key that will control the outwards zoom

Both accept either a javascript int char code or a string such as "A" or "UP"

```javascript
$("#selector").Zoom({
  in: 40,
  out: "up"
});
```
# Roadmap
- Add an option to allow scrollbar zooming
- Add smooth zoom animations
